Instructions on how to use CabsOnline taxi service:
- A user can use the system to book a taxi using booking.html
	- Enter you personal details and pickup time, date and address
	- The system will generate a booking reference number for the 	booking entered
	- The system provides a confirmation message in the html file to 	the user that the booking has been made

- An admin user can see the unassigned bookings using admin.html
	- The admin clicks the 'Show pick-up request' button
	- This shows all the bookings that have not been assigned yet

- An admin user can see the unassigned bookings using admin.html
	- The admin enters a booking reference number into the text field
	- Then click the 'assign a taxi' button
	- This assigns a taxi to the booking reference number
	- A confirmation is displaying under the buttons on admin.html
	- A message will also be displayed if the booking reference number 	entered does not exist

Known Bugs / Missing features
	- There is a field for the user to input their time of pickup but 	the server side processing does not receive using the $_POST 	method. To show the rest of the backend working, the 'pick up time' 	is set to the current time.
	- No date validation has been added. Dates in the past can be 	booked into the system.
